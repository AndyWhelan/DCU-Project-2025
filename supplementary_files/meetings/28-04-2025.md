# Summary of work since last time

* Adjusted the code to have a sinusoidal wall pattern [here](https://github.com/AndyWhelan/DCU-Project-2025/blob/main/PO_flat_strip.m)
* Went through Balanis chapters 1 through 6. Feel have much better understanding of fundamentals, and keeping a quick reference guide in Latex [here](https://github.com/AndyWhelan/DCU-Project-2025/blob/main/supplementary_files/various_notes/Balanis_Quick_Reference.pdf)

# Questions

1. Shouldn't we have `lambda = c0/f` in the code?
2. OK to continue with the notes on Balanis?
3. Further generalisations in addition to wall shape
4. Upcoming deadline for project plan.
