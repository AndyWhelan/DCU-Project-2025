# Summary of work since last time

* I spent some time coding trying to figure out the electric field components and ended up essentially with a product of Hankel functions. I tried plotting the cumulative value of the field and was convinced what I was doing was largely incorrect as there was no convergence, but setting the frequency to around your values showed some convergence.
* Got Balanis book and reviewed Green's functions a little along with the derivation of the Hankel functions in cylindrical setup.
* Reviewed and tidied code a little - to refactor / modify later.


# Questions

* Why is there no attenuation (e.g. Hankel functions) for the incident field?
* Looks like we're assuming the secondary source is proportional to *magnetic* current density ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_current)). Why are we assuming this?
* Expression for incident magnetic field `H^i(r) = (1/ω*μ0) ∇×E^i(r)`:
    * Is this Maxwell-Faraday? If so, shouldn't there be a time derivative for magnetic field? If not, where?
    * It looks like there's something other than 1 in the top (`j`?) - what is it?
    * Is the sign in the second expression correct? (refer to paper calcs)
* Do you mean to say the normal vector is `n = y`, not `n = z`? The calculation for `J^{PO}` only works if so.
* Why is the surface current on the plate `n × H`? (I understand the directionality via curl, but what about any normalization?)
* Why is the coefficient `kη0/4` in the  scattered field `kη0/4 * ∫ J_z(r') hankel(k(r-r')) dl`?
* Why no attenuation in the GO formulation `E_{GO} = E0 e^{-jk⋅r}`?
* Why don't the graphs match when I change the frequency to 3MHz or 30MHz?
* Why is `disc_per_wavelength = 20`?
* Why is strip length `40 * wavelength`?
* The `self` term for diagonal in MoM - demystify? e.g. the 1.781 number... seems to be explained in [this paper](https://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~brennanc/publications/papers/2012/RIA_2012_a.pdf) as `γ`?
* Plan of attack... what should I prioritize:
    * Adding the diffuse component,
    * Changing the wall shape (what would this affect in the calcs, e.g. for GO would I need to take into account slope of the wall at PoC, and would I need to take into account multiple bounces?)
    * Is it worth me modifying the code to do the TM polarization case?
    * Anything else important to vary?
