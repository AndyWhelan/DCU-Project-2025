> Let $dW$ be an infinitesimal surface element belonging to a building wall.

> S is defined as the ratio between local scattered field and incident field

$\implies S:= \frac{\vert E_s \vert }{\vert E_i \vert}\vert_{dW} $. Definition of
scattering parameter.

> The scattered wave is a non-uniform spherical wave whose amplitude is expressed by
$\vert E_s \vert = E_{S0}\sqrt{\cos \theta_s}$. 

Solid angle formula: $d \Omega = \sin \theta \ d \theta \ d \phi$

$S^2 E_i^2 $
